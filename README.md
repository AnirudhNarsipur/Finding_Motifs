# Finding Motifs Using Gibbs Sampling

This project implements Gibbs Sampling with background models and applies to find motifs
for transcription factors in Tuberculosis. 

This work was done solely by me (Anirudh Narsipur) as my final project for CSCI 1810 Computational Molecular Biology in Fall 2021 at Brown University. 

The main components are:
    
    Application.ipynb : Jupyter notebook that loads the data and runs the code
    background.py : Calculates background models
    project.py : The implementation of Gibbs Sampling
    FinalProjectPpt.pdf : A pdf version of the presentation I made in class
    Paper.pdf : A detailed paper explaining the project
